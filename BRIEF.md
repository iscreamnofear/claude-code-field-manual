# Claude Code Project Brief: Claude Code Field Manual

## What this project is

We're building a downloadable e-book called the **Claude Code Field Manual**. It's a practical guide for **non-technical professionals** (marketing, sales, customer success, ops) who want to use Claude Code and Cowork to build real things without waiting for a developer.

The writing is done. The content, structure, voice, callout system, and 10 project playbooks are complete and saved as a .docx file. What we need now is **production design**: turning a Word document into a beautifully designed, illustrated PDF e-book that looks like it came from a design agency, not a word processor.

## Where we are

### Completed:
- **Full manuscript** in `Claude_Code_Field_Manual_v4.docx` (509 paragraphs, validated)
- **Voice and tone**: Conversational, direct, sarcastic-but-kind. Mocks complexity, never mocks the reader.
- **Callout box system** with 8 types (each with emoji, title, accent color, background):
  - 💀 I LEARNED THIS THE HARD WAY (purple #553C9A / #FAF5FF)
  - ⏱️ SAVE YOURSELF 45 MINUTES (amber #B7791F / #FFFFF0)
  - 🔥 THIS WILL BREAK THINGS (red #C53030 / #FFF5F5)
  - 🤨 REALITY CHECK (green #276749 / #F0FFF4)
  - 💡 WORTH KNOWING (blue #2B6CB0 / #EBF8FF)
  - 🚨 DO NOT SKIP THIS (teal #0987A0 / #E6FFFA)
  - 💬 JARGON BUSTER (blue #2B6CB0 / #EBF8FF)
  - 📋 COPY THIS EXACTLY (green #276749 / #F0FFF4)
- **Typography**: Trebuchet MS (headings), Palatino Linotype (body), Consolas (code)
- **Color palette**: ink #1B2332, text #2D3748, muted #A0AEC0, rule #CBD5E0, bg #F7FAFC

### What's needed now:
1. **Install the Nano Banana design skill** for illustration and visual design capabilities
2. **Convert the .docx into a designed PDF e-book** with proper layout, illustrations, and professional polish
3. **Generate illustrations** in a consistent style across all chapters
4. **Design chapter opener pages**, section dividers, and visual elements
5. **Final output**: A PDF that looks like a premium, "most downloaded" lead-gen asset

## Target audience

Non-technical professionals who:
- Have never opened a terminal
- Don't know what "git" or "npm" means
- Work in marketing, sales, customer success, ops, or leadership
- Have ideas and projects stuck in dev backlogs
- Want to build things themselves: dashboards, websites, automations, internal tools

## Design direction

This should feel like a premium tech e-book. Not corporate. Not developer-bro. Not a whitepaper. Think: Intercom's guides, Stripe's documentation aesthetic, or a well-designed indie tech book. Clean, modern, with enough personality to be memorable.

- Illustrations should be consistent in style across the whole book
- Chapter openers should feel like section breaks, not just bigger text
- Code blocks and callout boxes need visual polish (the content/colors are defined, the rendering needs design treatment)
- The cover should be distinctive and shareable (people screenshot covers)
- Page layout should breathe — generous margins, whitespace, pull quotes

## Author

Ofir Bloch — SVP Corporate Marketing. The editorial voice in the manuscript is final. Don't soften it, don't add filler, don't corporate-ify it. The personality IS the product.
